# Research Navigation Fix - Final Resolution

## Problem
The research navigation was showing a "loading" message and not displaying the actual research content when clicking on "Forskning" in the navigation menu.

## Root Cause
The `loadPage` function in `index.html` was immediately falling back to `loadPageFallback` for research pages instead of attempting to load the research content properly.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Load Page Logic
- Modified `loadPage` function to attempt loading `research.html` when running on HTTP/HTTPS
- Added `loadResearchContent` function to embed research content directly when running on `file://` protocol
- Improved fallback handling

### 2. Added Embedded Research Content
- Created `loadResearchContent` function that embeds the full research page content directly into `index.html`
- Added all necessary HTML structure including:
  - Research info cards (research points, current tier)
  - Tier sections (Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2)
  - Research buttons with proper event handlers
  - Research history display

### 3. Added Research JavaScript Functions
- Added `researchTier(tier)` function for conducting research
- Added `updateResearchUI()` function to update the UI state
- Added `updateResearchHistory()` function to display research history
- Added proper interval management for automatic UI updates

### 4. Improved Page Management
- Added cleanup for research update intervals when switching pages
- Enhanced `initializePage` function to properly initialize research content
- Added automatic 5-second updates for research points

### 5. Enhanced Fallback
- Updated `getResearchHTML` fallback to provide better user experience
- Added buttons to reload or manually load research content

## Files Modified
- `c:\Users\jesper\Desktop\Samfunds-spil\index.html`
  - Fixed `loadPage` function logic
  - Added `loadResearchContent` function
  - Added research JavaScript functions
  - Improved page initialization and cleanup

## Testing
The research navigation now works properly in both HTTP and file:// environments:
- Clicking "Forskning" loads the full research interface
- Research points are displayed correctly
- Tier status updates properly
- Research buttons work as expected
- Research history is displayed
- Navigation back to game works seamlessly

## Result
The research navigation issue has been completely resolved. Users can now access the research page from the main navigation menu without seeing the loading message.
