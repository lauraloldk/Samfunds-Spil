# Power Plant Stamina Bonus Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview
Power plants now provide a **stamina bonus** to the player:
- Each power plant increases **max stamina by 10**
- Base stamina remains 10
- With power plants: Max stamina = 10 + (number of power plants Ã— 10)

## âš¡ Implementation Details

### 1. **Max Stamina Calculation**
```javascript
function getMaxStamina() {
    const buildings = Object.values(window.gameState.buildings);
    const powerPlantCount = buildings.filter(b => getBuildingType(b) === 'powerplant').length;
    
    // Basis stamina: 10, + 10 per kraftvÃ¦rk
    return 10 + (powerPlantCount * 10);
}
```

### 2. **UI Updates**
- **Stamina display**: Now shows "current/max" format (e.g., "15/20")
- **Power plant description**: Updated to mention the stamina bonus
- **Building effects**: Added `maxStamina: 10` to power plant effects

### 3. **Dynamic Stamina Management**
- **Turn regeneration**: Uses dynamic max stamina instead of hardcoded 10
- **Building construction**: Grants immediate stamina boost when building power plants
- **Demolition**: Caps current stamina to new max when removing power plants

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

#### `game-logic.js`
- Added `getMaxStamina()` function
- Updated `updateUI()` to show current/max stamina
- Modified `nextTurn()` to use dynamic max stamina for regeneration
- Enhanced `buildBuilding()` to grant immediate stamina when building power plants
- Updated `demolishBuilding()` to cap stamina when removing power plants

#### `gamedata.js`
- Updated power plant description: "Giver strÃ¸m til byen og Ã¸ger max stamina med 10"
- Added `maxStamina: 10` to power plant effects

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Impact

### Strategic Value
- **Power plants** are now more valuable beyond just providing power
- **Stamina management** becomes a key strategic consideration
- **Building order** matters - power plants enable more construction

### Balance Considerations
- **Cost vs benefit**: Power plants cost 2000 kr and 3 stamina, but provide 10 max stamina
- **Scalability**: Each additional power plant provides consistent +10 max stamina
- **Investment**: Early power plants enable more aggressive building strategies

## ðŸ“Š Examples

### Base Game
- **0 power plants**: Max stamina = 10
- **Current stamina**: Regenerates to max 10 per turn

### With Power Plants
- **1 power plant**: Max stamina = 20
- **2 power plants**: Max stamina = 30
- **3 power plants**: Max stamina = 40

### Practical Scenarios
1. **Early game**: Build 1 power plant â†’ Max stamina 20 â†’ Can build more per turn
2. **Mid game**: Build 2-3 power plants â†’ Max stamina 30-40 â†’ Major construction projects
3. **Late game**: Multiple power plants â†’ High max stamina â†’ Rapid city development
